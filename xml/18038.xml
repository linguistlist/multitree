          <pub-comments>Miluk and Hanis were the two languages of the Coosan family, formerly spoken in a small territory along the south-central coast of Oregon around Coos Bay. Both languages are often referred to as 'Coos' although they were quite distinct. Although some Hanis and Miluk people were removed to resevrations between 1855 and 1875, most remained in their traditional territory, where more than 150 descendants still reside. The Confererated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw was recognized in 1984, with tribal headquarters at Coos Bay. Extensive documentation of both Hanis and Miluk exists, from several linguists, including a number of sound recordings made by Jacobs in the 1930s. A number of narrative texts have been published in both languages and a grammatical sketch of Hanis. The last fluent speaker of Miluk died in 1939, and the last speaker of Hanis in 1972.</pub-comments>
