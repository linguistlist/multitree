### Why MultiTree?

MultiTree provides a unique approach to historical linguistic research, representing the most
complete collection of language relationship hypotheses in a user-friendly, visually-appealing,
and interactive format. Not only is it fun and informative, but it is a useful resource that gathers
scholarly work and makes it accessible to academics and the public alike.
                            
MultiTree is also an innovative tool for typological analysis, especially among lesser-known
languages. It facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration with linguists to reach
more accurate conclusions about human language, culture, and history.


### Disclaimer

The trees in MultiTree are intended to be faithful representations of their sources,
but sometimes it can be difficult to capture a scholar's intentions in a graphical
representation. Whenever possible, editors have added comments to disambiguate or
clarify their interpretations. However, it is always recommended that users refer to the
original source for a better understanding of the scholar's hypothesis.
                            
MultiTree aims to collect as many hypotheses about language relationships as possible
so that users may compare them. Inclusion of a tree does not indicate validity of the
scholar's hypothesis or acceptance by the academic community.
                            
**Regarding contact languages (creoles, pidgins, mixed languages) and language isolates**
Although isolates have no known genetic affiliation, and the origins of contact
languages are heavily contested, they have been included in the MultiTree
database in order to make information about them available to scholars and to accurately
represent whatever hypothesis the original scholar is making. "Trees" that include these
languages do not reflect genetic affiliation unless this was the intention of the author.
